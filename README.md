# CS-458-Project-1
## Project #1 Format

Data sources (You can choose your own but please use reputable databases. The following are examples) :
* https://cityobservatory.org/oregondotclimatefail/
* https://www.oregon.gov/energy/Data-and-Reports/Pages/Oregon-Electric-Vehicle-Dashboard.aspx
* https://www.oregon.gov/odot/Data/Pages/Crash.aspx
* https://nasa.github.io/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/

- Use R, matlab, excel or other software tool
- Produce 3-­‐page long document
   - Page 1: Title (meaningful to the visualization) and description (500+ words: motivation, describing data, and captions)
   - Page 2: Plot the data sets using plot functions and label the axes (captions)
   - Page 3: Visualize the data with software tools to create compelling figures (captions)


## Project #2 Format
Produce 4-page long document with figures on
   - Page 1: Title (meaningful to the content, e.g, scientific observation or conclusion) and paragraphs (500+ words describing the data and the network visualizations. Content on page 4 is not included in this title. )
   - Page 2: Use https://gephi.org to visualize the chosen data sets
   - Page 3: Use given codes to create glyphs. Please improve the codes if you can to create your own results.
   - Page 4: Demonstrate your uncertainty visualization (with a tool or just hand-drawn sketch) on your own networks ( The network that you create for your Project #1 observations/conclusions is very much encouraged to be used here as you likely have in-depth knowledge about this network) [[[Graduate students are required to include principles for designing the uncertainty visualizations that they create]]].

## Project #3 Format
This project is designed to include the "how" aspect of the problem/topic from Project #1 and Project #2. In Project #1, we focused on "what" patterns occurred in the numerical data. In Project #2, we focused on "why" these patterns appeared. In this project, we will focus on "how" these patterns were created.

Please make sure that the multi-view visualization provides a comprehensive understanding of the what, how and why aspects of your topic. 

- Step1: browse data that can be put on a map
   - https://carto.com/blog/eighty-data-visualizations-examples-using-location-data-maps/
   - You are welcome to find another data to practice with
- Step2: Produce 6-page long document with figures on
   - Page 1: Title and one paragraph (500+ words describing the aspects of your own topic that can incorporate location information and how the location information enhances the understanding of your topic. )
   - Page 2: One paragraph (600+ words contrasting 3 techniques of the 7 techniques discussed at https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2016/10/7-techniques-to-visualize-geospatial-data 
   - Page 3: Identify one tool to use from https://www.springboard.com/blog/31-free-data-visualization-tools/ and repeat a demo from this website. This tool is to give you new ideas on how to visualize the different aspects of your data. As a replacement, if you have attended Dr. Barnes' talk on 5/11, please submit some technical comments (+100 words) on one technique that you heard from the talk.
   - Page 4—6: Integrate figure, network graph, map, and text explanation into a multi-view visualization system for your topic. The figure, the graph, the map and the text should coherently describe the data to be visualized. Each page can be a snapshot of the data. [Graduate students are again asked to write down design principles for this system. Please include how the views should be coordinated and linked.]
